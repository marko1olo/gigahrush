# PR 43 - Pikabu/GamePush v3 Asset Follow-Up

Date: 2026-05-29.

Time window: 2026-05-29 02:05-02:16 UTC / 03:05-03:16 BST.

Scope: owner reported that the new build was uploaded to the Pikabu/GamePush project; this pass handled the non-legal remainder visible in the GamePush panel: promo image assets, Distribution recheck and basic hosted v3 availability.

## Result

GamePush project `28314` now shows `Actual draft version: 3` on Distribution. The v3 hosted build is reachable, and the top Distribution blockers for missing `Icon 1024x1024`, `Cover 1920x1080` and landscape screenshots disappeared after promo asset upload/generation.

Still blocked for owner/legal input: GamePush continues to show the `My Company` warning. It asks for owner or organization data needed for contract signature:

- owner's name;
- Tax ID Number / INN;
- phone number;
- date of birth or company establishment date.

These fields are personal/legal data and were not filled by the agent.

No public Pikabu catalog URL, public announcement, post, email, vote, rating, duplicate submission, payment/legal agreement or distribution final approval action was made.

## Browser Actions

Opened the authenticated GamePush panel:

- Promo Materials: `https://gamepush.com/panel/projects/28314/promo-materials/`
- Distribution: `https://gamepush.com/panel/projects/28314/distribution/`

Uploaded the existing local GamePush promo pack:

tmp/gamepush_promo_2026-05-28/gigahrush_screen_4_alife_1280x720.png
```

The GamePush Promo Materials page then showed icon and cover slots without the upload placeholder, and `Screenshot (album)` changed to `Upload more`.

Ran `Generate for all platforms`, selected `Pikabu`, with `English` and `Russian` selected by the modal. The modal finished with:

```txt
Congratulations!
Assets are ready, download has started now.
```

Downloaded `~/Downloads/assets.zip` existed but contained only an empty `Pikabu/` directory. Treat that downloaded ZIP as a GamePush generator artifact, not as the source of truth; the Distribution page is the useful recheck.

## Distribution Recheck

After upload/generation, Distribution showed:

```txt
Distribution status: In progress
Pikabu
Actual draft version: 3
```

Top warning remaining:

```txt
You have not filled in information about yourself or the organization yet.
You can fill it in advance in the My Company section.
The data is needed for contract signature.
```

The earlier top warnings for missing `Icon 1024x1024`, missing `Cover 1920x1080` and missing screenshots were no longer present.

The `Current project version` section still showed icon/cover/screenshot fields as `*Empty*`, but the same section also says:

```txt
Please fill in information about your game after we have accepted the game
```

So the current operational interpretation is: promo-material blockers are cleared for the in-progress Distribution pass; final project-version media may still need review or post-acceptance filling if GamePush asks.

## Hosted v3 Check

`curl -I https://s3.eponesh.com/games/28314/v3/` returned:

The hosted HTML contains:

```txt
<title>ГИГАХРУЩ - САМОСБОР</title>
gigahrush-portal" content="pikabu"
```

Browser opened `https://s3.eponesh.com/games/28314/v3/?portal=pikabu&qa=1`; document state was `complete`, title was `ГИГАХРУЩ - САМОСБОР`, and two visible canvases were present at `1200x883`.

This was not a full GamePush sandbox/cloud-save QA. Console capture, `progress` cloud-save save/load, pause/audio behavior, mobile scaling and moderator-facing sandbox checklist still need a real QA pass.

## Next Actions

1. Owner fills `https://gamepush.com/panel/account/company/` with real legal/personal data if they are comfortable proceeding with GamePush/Pikabu contract requirements.
2. Run GamePush `Test game` / sandbox QA for v3: launch, console, pause/audio, scaling, input, mobile and `progress` cloud-save.
3. Watch the moderator chat and Distribution status; do not create a duplicate Pikabu submission.
4. Do not announce a public Pikabu release until moderation accepts the game and a public catalog URL exists.

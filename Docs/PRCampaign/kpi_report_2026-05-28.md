# GIGAH|RUSH Media KPI Report - 2026-05-28

## Late Addendum - PR 38

At 2026-05-28 22:47 UTC / 23:47 BST, `Docs/PRCampaign/PR_38_next_posts_and_surfaces_2026-05-28.md` prepared new post/pitch copy and a next-surface scout. No public post, email, form submission, vote, rating, upload, portal final-click or account action was made. Fresh MyIndie public recheck still shows version `0.3.0`, updated `28.05.2026`, counters `20` views / `3` downloads / `26` web launches / `0` comments / `0` likes, author `Tenevik Games`, and clickable itch/direct/Telegram links.

Immediate updated action order: official Tenevik-owned short post on X/VK/Telegram/Bluesky if an account exists; one RU Indie Spotlight / ИНДИ.РФ proposal; exactly three EN editorial pitches to Big Boss Battle, Rely on Horror and The Indie Informer; ИграйТут portal prep only after account/artifact/browser-mobile QA; Reddit remains hold until owner manually clears captcha/account trust.

## Snapshot

| Surface | Status | Signal | Risk | Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MyIndie | Live / RU primary | Public counters found in PR 31 monitoring: version `0.3.0`, updated `2026-05-28`, `20` views, `3` downloads, `26` web launches, `0` comments. Previous report had `11` views, `2` downloads, `10` web plays. | Still no comments, so traffic is not yet discussion. | Use as first RU/CIS link. Monitor comments, web launch and link retention. |
| Direct build | Live / playable fallback | `https://gigahrush.bileter.workers.dev/` returned game HTML, title `ГИГАХРУЩ - САМОСБОР`, no `noindex`, canvas present. | Machine discovery is weak because direct build lacks real robots/sitemap/about metadata. | Keep as frictionless play link. Schedule SEO/about work. |
| itch.io | Live / EN mirror with discovery risk | Public page still contains `noindex`; playable iframe exists. | Search visibility remains broken. | Continue support/indexing monitoring; do not use itch as search-primary landing while `noindex` persists. |
| DTF follow-up | Live / repaired | Counters grew to `2` comments, `1` favorite, `661` views, `74` hits and `738` total. | Another DTF post or link bump would be spam-risk. | Monitor and answer concrete feedback only. |
| DTF old post | Live / proof point | Stable at `13` comments, `10` favorites, `7` reactions, `2 138` views, `569` hits and `2 737` total. | No new action without real comment/feedback. | Monitoring only. |
| Pikabu Games / GamePush | GamePush v2 hosted / Pikabu submitted | Project `ГИГАХРУЩ` / `28314` Hosting shows `Last published version: 2 published`, `Last draft version: 2 loaded`; public GamePush-hosted build `https://s3.eponesh.com/games/28314/v2/` returns title `ГИГАХРУЩ - САМОСБОР`. Distribution still says `Application submitted`, `Actual draft version: 2`. Player custom field `progress` now exists. | Not public on Pikabu catalog; sandbox still only `11%`, `1 / 9`; catalog card fields are empty until acceptance. | Monitor moderation. Do not duplicate-submit. After acceptance, fill card fields and rerun iframe/cloud-save QA. |
| Pikabu ordinary post | Live / correction retention check needed | Public HTML contains correction comment id `393697666`, but static fetch did not show MyIndie text. | A second correction would look like spam. | Recheck with browser/AJAX when practical. |
| GameDev.ru | Live / RU forum | Public HTML shows `TENEVIK`, `ГИГАХРУЩ` and MyIndie. | Link order caveat remains; duplicate thread would be bad. | Monitor replies/moderation only. |
| forum.indie.ru | Live / RU forum | Public HTML shows `TENEVIK`, `ГИГАХРУЩ` and MyIndie. | New account/new thread may still be moderated. | Monitor replies/moderation only. |
| GameDev.net | Live per authenticated check / public fetch blocked | Shell/public fetch still Cloudflare `403`, consistent with prior reports. | Need clean-browser verification before treating curl failure as hidden state. | Clean-browser verification only. |
| HTML5GameDevs | Submitted / public not confirmed | Public fetch challenged/blocked; web search did not find topic. | Moderator approval may still be pending. | Recheck public/logged-out visibility. Do not repost. |

## Good Signs

- MyIndie traffic moved: views, downloads and web launches all rose since the previous report.
- DTF follow-up traffic rose from `297` total to `738` total, with a second comment and first favorite.
- Direct browser build remains available and indexable enough for a frictionless play fallback.
- Pikabu Games is no longer only a prep task: GamePush project `28314` has a hosted v2 build, and the required `progress` player field now exists.
- GameDev.ru and forum.indie.ru are live and keep MyIndie visible.
- The six-lane pass produced a usable next queue without creating duplicate posts.

## Bad Signs

- itch.io still has `noindex`, so it remains weak for discovery.
- Pikabu Games is not public yet and cannot be announced as a catalog listing; GamePush sandbox still shows only `1 / 9` checklist progress.
- Reddit has cooldown/spam risk after the 2026-05-24 burst and r/IndieDev removal.
- GameDev.net and HTML5GameDevs still need clean-browser/public verification.
- DevTribe remains blocked by account/email state.
- Direct build needs normal machine-readable SEO basics before Google/Bing/Yandex/AI surfaces can reliably cite it.

## Feedback Themes To Watch

- First 10-15 minutes: controls, first objective, expedition prep, UI readability.
- Survival fit: food/water/body pressure and whether players understand the loop.
- Performance and blank-canvas risk on direct/portal builds.
- Samosbor clarity: whether danger reads as learnable, not random noise.
- AI suspicion and old-author identity confusion: keep Tenevik Games and factual authorship consistent.

## Fix Queue

- Direct build: add real `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, meta description, OG/Twitter image, canonical, visible public about/FAQ or `/about`, and factual JSON-LD later.
- PR copy: keep `ГИГАХРУЩ`, `GIGAH|RUSH`, `GIGAH RUSH`, `Gigahrush`, Tenevik Games, MyIndie/direct/itch consistent.
- Portal: prepare exact `1024x1024` icon, cover, four landscape screenshots, keywords and final RU/EN catalog text for GamePush/Pikabu after acceptance.
- Reddit: only one native-media post, preferably `r/SurvivalGaming`, if someone can monitor comments afterward.
- EN media: send no more than three tailored pitches in one sitting if using Tenevik-owned outbound.

## Next Actions

1. Publish one official Tenevik-owned short post on X/VK/Telegram/Bluesky if an account exists; use the PR 38 media-first copy and do not stuff hashtags.
2. Send one RU proposal to Indie Spotlight / ИНДИ.РФ with MyIndie first, direct build second, one GIF and contact sheet.
3. Send, if owner/operator chooses outbound today, exactly three tailored EN pitches: Big Boss Battle, Rely on Horror, The Indie Informer.
4. Monitor GamePush project `28314`; when moderation accepts the Pikabu submission, fill empty card fields and rerun iframe QA before announcing Pikabu Games.
5. Prepare ИграйТут only after account/developer access, artifact/media preflight and browser/mobile QA; keep KickoutGames/GameBolt/GrandGames lower priority.
6. Keep Reddit on hold until owner manually clears captcha/account trust; then use PR 35 profile-native-media before any subreddit retry.
7. Recheck itch `noindex`, MyIndie counters, DTF follow-up comments, GameDev.net clean-browser visibility and HTML5GameDevs moderation state.

## Owner Needed

- Tenevik-owned outbound identity for media email/form sends.
- Tenevik public X account if Grok/X visibility is desired.
- DevTribe email confirmation before posting there.
- GamePush dashboard access for project `28314`, `progress` field verification and moderation result.
- Approval before any ИграйТут, KickoutGames, VK Play, Yandex Games or other portal submission.
